Hiya, heya, how's it going?

Welcome to [https://lycanthropy.dev](https://lycanthropy.dev), my place to write about things I am passionate about.
Most of those things are probably Ruby, Rust or Math related. That's basically all I care about doing these days, so
get ready to read a lot that here.

Let's talk about the elephant in the room, the font. You might have noticed its _Comic Sans_, \*gasp\*, more specifically it's [Comic Code](https://tosche.net/fonts/comic-code) by [Toshi Omagari](https://tosche.net/profile). Keep and open mind and give it a try, you might be surprised.

Some background on me. I studied Math and I've got a degree in that, but I've been working as a software engineer for the past 3-ish years. I absolutely adore programming, it let's me solve tons of awesome problems and bring ideas to life that I wouldn't be able to otherwise.

You can find all of my projects on my GitHub on the left. Hover the image, it does something cool :)

Have fun exploring, if you find something cool, gimme a shout on my socials!
