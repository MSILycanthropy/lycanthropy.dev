Hiya, heya, how's it going? I'm Ethan.

Welcome to [https://lycanthropy.dev](https://lycanthropy.dev), the place I write about nerdy stuff.
I'm incredibly passionate about Ruby, Rust and Math, so get ready for a lot of that. I'm a software engineer
with a focus on web stuff, but I'm an avid dabbler, so you'll find a bit of everything here.

Let's talk about the elephant in the room, the font. You might have noticed its _Comic Sans_, \*gasp\*, more specifically it's [Comic Code](https://tosche.net/fonts/comic-code){:target="_blank"} by [Toshi Omagari](https://tosche.net/profile){:target="_blank"}. Keep and open mind and give it a try, you might be surprised.

Some background on me. I studied Math and I've got a degree in that, but I've been working as a software engineer for the past 3-ish years. I absolutely adore programming, it let's me solve tons of awesome problems and bring ideas to life that I wouldn't be able to otherwise.

You can find all of my projects on my GitHub on the left. Hover the image, it does something cool :)

Have fun exploring!

\- Ethan
